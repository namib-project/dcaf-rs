//! An implementation of the [ACE-OAuth framework](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-46.html).
//!
//! This crate implements the ACE-OAuth
//! (Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments using the OAuth 2.0 Framework)
//! framework as defined in [`draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-46`](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-46.html).
//! Key features include CBOR-(de-)serializable data models such as [`AccessTokenRequest`],
//! as well as the possibility to create COSE encrypted/signed access tokens
//! (as described in the draft) along with decryption/verification functions.
//! Implementations of the cryptographic functions must be provided by the user by implementing
//! [`CoseEncrypt0Cipher`] or [`CoseSign1Cipher`].
//!
//! Note that actually transmitting the serialized values (e.g. via CoAP) or providing more complex
//! features not mentioned in the ACE-OAuth Internet Draft (e.g. a permission management system for
//! the Authorization Server) is *out of scope* for this crate.
//! This also applies to cryptographic functions, as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
//!
//! The name DCAF was chosen because eventually, it's planned for this crate to support
//! functionality from the [Delegated CoAP Authentication and Authorization Framework (DCAF)](https://dcaf.science/)
//! specified in [`draft-gerdes-ace-dcaf-authorize`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-gerdes-ace-dcaf-authorize-04)
//! (which was specified prior to ACE-OAuth and inspired many design choices in it)---
//! specifically, it's planned to support using a CAM (Client Authorization Manager)
//! instead of just a SAM (Server Authorization Manager), as is done in ACE-OAuth.
//! Compatibility with the existing [DCAF implementation in C](https://gitlab.informatik.uni-bremen.de/DCAF/dcaf)
//! (which we'll call `libdcaf` to disambiguate from `dcaf` referring to this crate) is also an
//! additional design goal, though the primary objective is still to support ACE-OAuth.
//!
//! As one of the possible use-cases for this crate is usage on constrained IoT devices,
//! requirements are minimal---as such, while `alloc` is still needed, this crate offers
//! `no_std` support by omitting the default `std` feature.
//!
//! # Usage
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! dcaf = { version = "^0.3" }
//! ```
//! Or, if you plan to use this crate in a `no_std` environment:
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! dcaf = { version = "^0.3", default-features = false }
//! ```
//!
//! # Example
//! As mentioned, the main features of this crate are ACE-OAuth data models and
//! token creation/verification functions. We'll quickly introduce both of these here.
//!
//! ## Data models
//! [For example](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-46.html#figure-7),
//! say you (the client) want to request an access token from an Authorization Server.
//! For this, you'd need to create an [`AccessTokenRequest`], which has to include at least a
//! `client_id`. We'll also specify an audience, a scope (using [`TextEncodedScope`]---note that
//! [binary-encoded scopes](BinaryEncodedScope) or [AIF-encoded scopes](AifEncodedScope) would also work), as well as a
//! [`ProofOfPossessionKey`] (the key the access token should be bound to) in the `req_cnf` field.
//!
//! Creating, serializing and then de-serializing such a structure would look like this:
//! ```
//! # use std::error::Error;
//! use dcaf::{AccessTokenRequest, ToCborMap, ProofOfPossessionKey, TextEncodedScope};
//!
//! # #[cfg(feature = "std")] {
//! let request = AccessTokenRequest::builder()
//!    .client_id("myclient")
//!    .audience("valve242")
//!    .scope(TextEncodedScope::try_from("read")?)
//!    .req_cnf(ProofOfPossessionKey::KeyId(base64::decode("6kg0dXJM13U")?))
//!    .build()?;
//! let mut encoded = Vec::new();
//! request.clone().serialize_into(&mut encoded)?;
//! assert_eq!(AccessTokenRequest::deserialize_from(encoded.as_slice())?, request);
//! # }
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! ## Access Tokens
//! Following up from the previous example, let's assume we now want to create a signed
//! access token containing the existing `key`, as well as claims about the audience and issuer
//! of the token, using an existing `cipher`[^cipher]:
//! ```
//! # use ciborium::value::Value;
//! # use dcaf::error::{AccessTokenError, CoseCipherError};
//! # use dcaf::{CoseCipherCommon, CoseSign1Cipher, ProofOfPossessionKey};
//! use dcaf::{ToCborMap, sign_access_token, verify_access_token};
//! use coset::cwt::ClaimsSetBuilder;
//! use coset::Header;
//! use coset::iana::CwtClaimName;
//!
//! # struct FakeCipher {};
//! # impl CoseCipherCommon for FakeCipher {
//! #     type Error = String;
//! #
//! #     fn header(&self, unprotected_header: &mut Header, protected_header: &mut Header) -> Result<(), CoseCipherError<Self::Error>> {
//! #         Ok(())
//! #     }
//! # }
//! # impl CoseSign1Cipher for FakeCipher {
//! #     fn generate_signature(&mut self, target: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
//! #         target.to_vec()
//! #     }
//! #     fn verify_signature(&mut self, signature: &[u8], signed_data: &[u8]) -> Result<(), CoseCipherError<Self::Error>> {
//! #         if signature.to_vec() != self.generate_signature(signed_data) {
//! #             Err(CoseCipherError::VerificationFailure)
//! #         } else {
//! #             Ok(())
//! #         }
//! #     }
//! # }
//! # let key = ProofOfPossessionKey::KeyId(vec![0xDC, 0xAF]);
//! # let mut cipher = FakeCipher {};
//! let claims = ClaimsSetBuilder::new()
//!    .audience("valve242".to_string())
//!    .claim(CwtClaimName::Cnf, key.to_ciborium_value())
//!    .claim(CwtClaimName::Scope, Value::Text("read".to_string()))
//!    .build();
//! let token = sign_access_token(claims, &mut cipher, None, None, None)?;
//! assert!(verify_access_token(&token, &mut cipher, None).is_ok());
//! # Ok::<(), AccessTokenError<String>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! [^cipher]: Note that we are deliberately omitting details about the implementation of the
//! `cipher` here, since such implementations won't be in scope of this crate.
//!
//! # Provided Data Models
//!
//! ## Token Endpoint
//! The most commonly used models will probably be the token endpoint's [`AccessTokenRequest`] and
//! [`AccessTokenResponse`] described in [section 5.8 of the ACE-OAuth draft](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-46.html#section-5.8).
//! In case of an error, an [`ErrorResponse`] should be used.
//!
//! After an initial Unauthorized Resource Request Message, an [`AuthServerRequestCreationHint`] can
//! be used to provide additional information to the client, as described in
//! [section 5.3 of the ACE-OAuth draft](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-46.html#section-5.3).
//!
//! ## Common Data Types
//! Some types used across multiple scenarios include:
//! - [`Scope`] (as described in [section 5.8.1 of the ACE-OAuth draft](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-46.html#section-5.8.1)),
//!   either as a [`TextEncodedScope`], a [`BinaryEncodedScope`] or an [`AifEncodedScope`].
//! - [`ProofOfPossessionKey`] as specified in [section 3.1 of RFC 8747](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8747#section-3.1).
//!   For example, this will be used in the access token's `cnf` claim.
//! - While not really a data type, various constants representing values used in ACE-OAuth
//!   are provided in the [`constants`](crate::common::constants) module.
//!
//! # Creating Access Tokens
//! In order to create access tokens, you can use either [`encrypt_access_token`] or
//! [`sign_access_token`], depending on whether you want the access token to be wrapped in a
//! `COSE_Encrypt0` or `COSE_Sign1` structure. Support for a combination of both is planned for the
//! future.
//!
//! Both functions take a [`ClaimsSet`](coset::cwt::ClaimsSet) containing the claims that
//! shall be part of the access token, a cipher implementing the cryptographic operations
//! (explained further below), as well as optional `aad` (additional authenticated data)
//! and un-/protected headers.
//! Note that if the headers you pass in set fields which the cipher wants to set as well,
//! the function will fail with a
//! [`HeaderAlreadySet`](crate::error::CoseCipherError::HeaderAlreadySet) error.
//! The function will return a [`Result`] of the opaque [`ByteString`] containing the access token.
//!
//! # Verifying / decrypting Access Tokens
//! In order to verify or decrypt existing access tokens represented as [`ByteString`]s,
//! use [`verify_access_token`] or [`decrypt_access_token`] respectively.
//!
//! Both functions take the access token, a `cipher` for the cryptographic operations and an
//! optional `aad` (additional authenticated data).
//!
//! [`decrypt_access_token`] will return a result containing the decrypted
//! [`ClaimsSet`](coset::cwt::ClaimsSet).
//! [`verify_access_token`] will return an empty result which indicates that the token
//! was successfully verified---an [`Err`](Result::Err) would indicate failure.
//!
//! # Extracting Headers from an Access Token
//! Regardless of whether token was signed, encrypted, or MAC-tagged, you can extract its
//! headers using [`get_token_headers`], which will return an option containing both
//! unprotected and protected headers (or which will be [`None`](Option::None) in case
//! the token is invalid or neither a `COSE_Sign1`, `COSE_Encrypt0`, or `COSE_Mac0` structure).
//!
//! # COSE Cipher
//! As mentioned before, cryptographic functions are outside the scope of this crate.
//! For this reason, the various COSE cipher traits exist; namely,
//! [`CoseEncrypt0Cipher`], [`CoseSign1Cipher`], and [`CoseMac0Cipher`], each implementing
//! a corresponding COSE operation as specified in sections 4, 5, and 6 of
//! [RFC 8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152).
//!
//! Note that these ciphers *don't* need to wrap their results in e.g. a `Cose_Encrypt0` structure,
//! this part is already handled using this library (which uses [`coset`])---only the
//! cryptographic algorithms themselves need to be implemented (e.g. step 4 of
//! "how to decrypt a message" in [section 5.3 of RFC 8152](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152#section-5.3)).
//!
//! When implementing any of the specific COSE ciphers, you'll also need to implement the
//! [`CoseCipherCommon`] trait, which can be used to set headers specific to your COSE cipher
//! (e.g. the used algorithm).
